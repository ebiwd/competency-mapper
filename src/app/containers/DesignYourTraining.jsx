        Competencies can be used to develop training or other learning
        interventions, by asking what competencies the learners need to gain.{' '}

        The Competency Hub can help you at different stages of the process of
        designing your training:{' '}

      <h3>Define your audience:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the competency framework appropriate for your audience</li>
        <li>
          If career profiles are available, check the roles of your audience and
          the levels at which competencies are expected for those roles
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Define the competencies to cover:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the competencies that you need to focus on</li>
        <li>
          Find knowledge, skills or attitudes within the competencies that your
          learners need to achieve
        </li>
        <li>
          Use career profiles to decide the level of competence to be achieved
          in the course, depending on the audience and their goal
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Develop content to cover the selected competencies</h3>
      <h3>Assessment:</h3>

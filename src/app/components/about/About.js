    <h2>About Competency Hub</h2>
    <p className="lead">
      The Competency Hub is a repository of competency frameworks that define
      the abilities required by professionals in a specific field and relate
      them to training resources and career profiles, so that you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Assess your abilities against a professional standard and example career
        profiles{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        Find training resources to develop specific competencies and progress in
        your career
      </li>
      <li>
        Design training courses and programmes that help your learners develop
        specific competencies
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Career profiles</h3>
    <p>
      In this section, you will find a series of reference personas, example
      descriptions of professional roles.
    </p>
    <p>Each profile shows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The level at which each competency is required to fulfil that role
      </li>
      <li>Qualifications and background</li>
      <li>Activities of the role</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can create your own profile by assessing yourself against the list of
      competencies and then compare your profile to the existing ones. This
      allows you to see which competencies you need to develop further to
      perform that role.
    </p>

    <p>The profile that you create is saved on your own browser.</p>

    <p>
      Not all the competency frameworks on the site contain career profiles.
    </p>

    <h3>Find training resources</h3>
    <p>
      Training resources are presented associated with the competencies that
      they contribute to develop. You can find this information on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The page for each training resource, which shows a list of related
        competencies
      </li>
      <li>
        The page for each competency, which shows a list of related training
        resources
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Not all the competency frameworks on the site contain training resources.
    </p>

    <h3>Design training</h3>
    <p>
      You can design competency-based courses and course programmes using the
      Competency Hub. For more information on how to do this, visit the{' '}
      <a href="design-your-training"> design training</a> section of the site.
    </p>

    <h3>Competency</h3>
    <p>
      A competency is an observable ability of any professional. A competency
      can be defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes to make
      it more concrete and useful for individual professionals. It is
      observable, so its acquisition can be validated objectively.
    </p>

    <h3>Competency framework</h3>
    <p>
      A competency framework defines a core set of competencies required by
      professionals working in a specific field. In the Competency Hub, the
      professionals covered by the framework are specified on the entry card for
      each competency framework.
    </p>

    <p>
      A competency framework can specify which competencies are especially
      relevant for professionals in different roles or at different career
      stages, which is what is done in the Competency Hub for the frameworks
      that include career profiles.
    </p>

    <h3>Competency-based practices</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Competency allows individual professionals to assess themselves against
        a professional standard, and seek appropriate continuing professional
        development and/or develop their own careers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professional bodies can use competency to define competency frameworks
        for different roles or professions. These can form the basis of
        recognised professional standards, especially in regulated professions,
        for example healthcare and engineering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learning professionals can use competencies to develop training or other
        learning interventions, by asking what competencies their learners need
        to gain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learning professionals can ascertain whether training delivered has
        enabled learners to gain a competency or a set of competencies, by
        assessing whether knowledge has been transferred, skills have been
        developed, and/or behaviours/attitudes have changed as a result of the
        training.
      </li>
      <li>
        Competency can be used to determine whether curricula or training
        materials meet professional standards, identify course providers who can
        deliver training of the required quality, and support trainers to meet
        or exceed the required standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Competency can be used by employers to assess skills requirements, write
        job descriptions, determine whether candidates are appropriate for
        roles, and support employees to develop further in their roles.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </>
